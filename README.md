# 🚀 React useRef, useMemo, useCallback Hooks Practice Projects

A collection of React + useEffect practice projects with real-world APIs.
Each mini-project focuses on a specific concept like API fetching, debouncing, pagination, infinite scroll, polling, and device state detection.

# 1. Stopwatch / Timer App (⏱ useRef)
Scope:
 - Build a stopwatch with Start, Pause, Reset.
 - Use useRef to store the timer ID (so it doesn’t reset every render).
 - Display elapsed time in HH:MM:SS.
👉 Learn: useRef for intervals & storing values without re-render.

# 2. Expensive Calculation Dashboard (📊 useMemo)
Scope:
 - Show a list of numbers (e.g., from API).
 - Add a button to sort/filter large data.
 - Use useMemo to optimize the expensive calculation (sorting/filtering).
👉 Learn: useMemo to avoid re-calculating on every render.
